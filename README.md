# PicoJoinProject

I completed this project for my Capstone project in my undergraduate degree. The research paper was submitted to the 2021 Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies conference and passed the peer review but was not accepted due to the limited spaces of the conference and constraints due to COVID lockdowns.

## Abstract

An emerging problem in the field of data computation is the rising total power consumption of data servers. Traditional data servers typically use between 500 and 1200 Watts of electricity. Low-power low cost micro-controllers such as the recent Raspberry Pi Pico have the potential to replace these large data servers whilst only consuming a fraction of the electricity. The Raspberry Pi Pico consumes only 0.3 Watts but only has 264 Kilobytes of RAM and 2 Megabytes of flash storage for a cost of roughly $4 USD. In this work we demonstrate an efficient join algorithm that is performed using both a computer and Raspberry Pi Pico to establish the capability of micro-controllers in performing typical data computation operations. We also compare this with an implementation in MySQL to simulate a typical data serverâ€™s operation of the same algorithm. This work aims to prove that such operations can be done using micro-controllers, allowing for future work into using multiple micro-controllers cohesively to match the same operational power of a traditional data server with only a fraction of the electricity consumption.
